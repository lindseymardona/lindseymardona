# hi, i'm lindsey! 🌸 /ᐠ˵- ᴗ -˵マ ᶻ 𝗓 𐰁
<b>💻 programmer / 🎨 designer / 🎶 singer </b> <br>

i'm a developer and designer based in the sf bay area. i'm passionate about innovation with intent, human-centered design, and empowering users through technology. i'm also an alum from ucla, where i studied cognitive science w/ a specialization in computing and double minored in digital humanities and data science engineering. go bruins! 🐻💙💛

in my spare time, i enjoy singing little covers on the internet (歌ってみた), motion graphics animating, curling up with a cup of tea and a book or video game, studying languages, and learning how to cook. recently, i've been playing a lot of honkai star rail. i've also been starting to write music lately!

being from an indonesian family and having a killer cook for a mom has turned me into an avid foodie. (fun fact, she used to make my siblings and i taste her food and list as many ingredients as we could taste. i think that's what taught me how to really appreciate food!) this only continued to develop further during my time in college in sunny la. i'm always eager to try new restaurants and new cuisine, so if you have any recommendations, please feel free to send them my way!
